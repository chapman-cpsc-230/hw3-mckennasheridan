## Description

In this assignment, I had to complete two assignments from the text. The first assignment required me to explain what certain Boolean expressions mean in Python. The second assignment required me to explain what a certain code did and what the problem with it was.
I also had to complete two assignments not from the text. In the first assignment, I had to create a code that drew a polygon using the turtle function. This code asked the user for number of sides and side length. The second assignment required me to draw a star using the turtle function. This code asked the user for the number of points on the star.

## What I Learned from This

In this assignment, I learned about for loops and proper indentation when using these loops. I also learned some basic Boolean expressions. Finally, I learned that Python rounds large decimals and that some codes will not come up with the exact answer.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

McKenna Sheridan
