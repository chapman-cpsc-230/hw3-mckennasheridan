C = 41
#Sets variable C equal to 41
C == 40
#Sets variable C equal to 40
C!=40 and C<40
#C cannot equal 40 AND C must be less than 40 to make statement True
C!=40 or C<41
#Only one of the two conditions needs to be true to make statement True
not C == 40
#If the C equals 40, the statment is false. This basically reverses the evaluation of C == 40.
not C>40
#If C is greater than 40, statement is false.
C <= 41
#C must be less than or equal to 41 in order for the statement to be True.
